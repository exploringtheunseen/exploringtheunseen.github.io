AlgoAsylum works extensively with (mainly engineering and science) students in India and abroad. While we focus on the technical details of a variety of subjects, there are a few glaring issues that severly limit the potential of these students.

* The lack of thinking: The 'hot topics' right now are data analytics and machine learning. Unfortunately, students approach these from an engineering perspective, focusing on the implementation and the algorithms, but not on the larger meaning of what they are doing, or why (we lack analysis skills though doing analytics!).

* The lack of awareness: In an abstract sense, we know pollution is 'bad', but do not go beyond this qualitative judgment. We know that the monsoon patterns have changed over the past few years, but not by how much. The list goes on.

* The lack of confidence: We are afraid to take a stand, and if challenged, unable to defend our position with data. This is true of professionals as well as of students.

* The lack of expression: This is a consequence of our education system; the ability to convey ideas clearly is not something that is prioritized. As a consequence, we have seen wonderful ideas being discarded because they were not described clearly.

The common thread in all of the above is a lack of opportunity and a lack of good role models. 

This website aims to address both issues. Opportunity is knocking: we provide a platform, ideas for articles and guidance. We collectively act as role models: go through the articles here, they have been written by students such as yourselves. Why not contribute your own thoughts, and learn essential skills along the way?

Typical college coursework sticks to simplified, standard questions with rigid expectations. We develop and solicit articles that go beyond the obvious, getting students to think for themselves and encouraging them to express themselves. We provide a platform and support and guidance for students wanting to go beyond the academic curriculum. And we hope to foster a conversation about the world that we live in and how we can make it a better place.
